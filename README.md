## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at McGill University dedicated to finidng life beyond Earth. I study the geology, ecology, and organic geochemistry of our planetâ€™s most extreme environments, using these lessons as blueprints to understand what extraterrestrial lifeforms may look like and where they may live. I am part of the Science Team for the Perseverance Rover, helping to operate the SuperCam instrument and interpret the geochemical compositon of Mars' surface rocks and soils. 

The only thing I enjoy more than devising ways to find life on Mars is talking about it.
